Create the template for Cisco routers , where
	i) router name will be different, script will ask the router hostname.

	ii) script will ask the username and password for the router,
	and make sure you type the right password , so it will ask to reenter the password.
	make sure when you type the password it is invisible.

	all other configuration will be same for all routers.
