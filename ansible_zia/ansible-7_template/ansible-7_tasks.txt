Create the template for Cisco routers , where 
	i) router name will be different, script will ask the router hostname

	ii) script will ask the username and password for the router, 
	and make sure you type the right password , so it will ask to reenter the password.
	make sure when you type the password it is invisible.

	iii)configure 2 interfaces , where you will provide the ip/subnet mask.

all other configuration will be same for all routers.
